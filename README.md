# Secure Medical Data Transmission System

## Overview

The Secure Medical Data Transmission System is a Maven-based project designed for safeguarding the transmission of sensitive medical data. By employing a combination of cryptography and steganography techniques, this system ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and secure exchange of patient records.

## Features

- **Cryptography:** Utilizes advanced encryption algorithms for secure data storage and transmission.
- **Steganography:** Embeds encrypted medical data within images to provide an additional layer of concealment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface for easy data encoding and decoding.
- **Enhanced Security:** Hybrid approach for improved data protection.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Does not rely on a centralized database, ensuring data privacy.
